<h2 align="left"> My Coding Journey: </h2>

<p>In October 2023, I enrolled as a full-time student at Ada Tech School. I have since been dedicating my time to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
My ultimate goal is to become a full-stack developer, as I believe having a comprehensive understanding of the programming environment is crucial to building efficient and innovative solutions.

- I have been actively working on algorithmic exercises to improve my problem-solving skills. 
- I have also been part of full group projects, where I have had the opportunity to collaborate with others and learn from their experiences. 
- Additionally, I am continually learning about the development world and staying up-to-date with the latest technology news and best practices.</p>
