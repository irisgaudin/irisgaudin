<h1 align="center">Hey there!👋 I'm Iris </h1>
<h2 align="left"> My Coding Journey </h2>

<p>In October 2022, I took the leap and enrolled as a full-time student at Ada Tech School.</p>
<p>Since then, I've been diving into the world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My ultimate goal is to become a full-stack developer because I believe that having a complete understanding of the programming environment is key to creating awesome and cutting-edge solutions.

- 🎲I've been challenging myself with algorithmic exercises to boost my problem-solving skills, and it's been super rewarding!
- 🚀I've also had the chance to team up with others on some amazing full group projects. Working together and learning from my teammates has been an incredible experience.
- 🔍On top of all that, I'm always keeping an eye on the latest tech news and best practices in the development world. It's so cool to be part of this fast-paced and ever-evolving industry!</p>
